#This file lists the locations and dbkeys of all the fasta files
#under the "genome" directory (a directory that contains a directory
#for each build). 
This file has the format (white space characters are TAB characters):
#
#<unique_build_id>      <dbkey>         <display_name>  <file_path>
#
#So, it could look something like this:
#
#hg19canon      hg19            Human (Homo sapiens): hg19 Canonical            /path/to/genome/hg19/hg19canon.fa
#hg19full       hg19            Human (Homo sapiens): hg19 Full                 /path/to/genome/hg19/hg19full.fa
#
#Your .loc file should contain an entry for each individual
#fasta file. So there will be multiple fasta files for each build,
#such as with hg19 above.
hg19	hg19	Human hg19	${__HERE__}/cached_locally/cached_region.fa
