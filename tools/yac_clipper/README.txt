This tool clips adapter sequences from a fastq file and outputs either a    
fasta or fastq file of clipped reads with renumbered fasta/fastq headers.

Clipped sequences with Ns can be discarded.

Min size and max size filter clipped reads on their size.

Note that unclipped reads that satisfy the min and max size conditions are kept.
