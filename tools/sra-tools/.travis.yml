# This is a special configuration file to run tests on Travis-CI via
# GitHub notifications when changes are committed.

# See http://travis-ci.org/ for details

# This file is heavily inspired by Peter Cock's efforts. See more details at

# We need Python 2.6 or 2.7 to run Galaxy but many Galaxy tools also need Java
# to run the simplest way to get that installed is to just start with "java".
# (which will still have a system python installed).
