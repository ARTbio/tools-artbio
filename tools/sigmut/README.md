**INTRODUCTION**

SigMut creates mutational matrices for all types of somatic mutations. It allows downsizing the generated mutations only to parts for the genome (e.g., exome or a custom BED file). The tool seamlessly integrates with other SigProfiler tools. 

**PREREQUISITES**

By default the installation process will save the FASTA files for all chromosomes for the default genome 
assemblies (GRCh37, GRCH38, mm10, mm9, rn6). As a result, ~3 Gb of storage must be available for the downloads for each genome.

**QUICK START GUIDE**


**INPUT FILE FORMAT**

This tool currently supports maf, vcf, simple text file, and ICGC formats. The user must provide variant data adhering to one of these four formats. If the userâ€™s files are in vcf format, each sample must be saved as a separate files. 

**SUPPORTED GENOMES**

This tool currently supports the following genomes:
